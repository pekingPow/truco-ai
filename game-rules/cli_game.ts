// Start a 2-player Truco match

// Read from terminal input (e.g. prompt() or readline)

// Prompt Player 1, show hand

// Wait for card selection

// Repeat for Player 2

// Print result of the round

// Turn engine or controller:

// If state.ts and truco_reducer.ts include "whose turn" logic, you might already have this.
